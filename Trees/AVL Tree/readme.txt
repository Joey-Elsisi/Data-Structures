Assignemnt:

The objective of this lab is to understand the runtime characteristics and trade-offs between normal Binary search trees and AVL trees. You will have to implement an AVL tree and write a brief report to compare its performance with the Binary search tree implemented for the in-lab.

The report for this lab should contain the following:

1. Your name, the date, and your CS 2150 lab section.
2. A discussion of what testfile1.txt, testfile2.txt, and testfile3.txt suggest about the relative performance of AVL trees and Binary search trees.
3. A description of the space-time tradeoff between the two implementations.
4. A characterization of situations where AVL trees are preferable to Binary search trees.
